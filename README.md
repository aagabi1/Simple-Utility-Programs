# Simple-Utility-Programs
This is intended to be a project with simple implementations of complex processes.
For instance, a text editor that is basically a stripped version of NotePad or MS Word.
The idea is to underdstand the fundamental processes that work behind the scenes and essentially replicate them.
Code should be clear, concise and understandable.
Contributions are welcome.
If you see a complex idea that you can break down into simple code, feel free to give it a whirl!
